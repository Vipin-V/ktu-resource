## SSH Keys

An SSH key is an access credential for the SSH (secure shell) network protocol. This authenticated and encrypted secure network protocol is used for remote communication between machines on an [unsecured open network](https://whatismyipaddress.com/unsecured-network). SSH is used for remote file transfer, network management, and remote operating system access. The SSH acronym is also used to describe a set of tools used to interact with the SSH protocol.

SSH uses a pair of keys to initiate a secure handshake between remote parties. The key pair contains a public and private key.&#x20;

## How to create SSH Keys?

Generate ssh file. Type the command in gitbash.

```bash
ssh-keygen -o
```

* It will generate a .ssh file in C/Users/\<your respective folder name>/.ssh.
* When asked to enter a passphrase, just type the enter key.
* When asked to enter the same passphrase again, type enter key.

Get into the ssh file&#x20;

```bash
cd .ssh
```

List the current files in it.

```bash
ls
```

and open id\_rsa.pub.&#x20;

```bash
cat id_rsa.pub
```
