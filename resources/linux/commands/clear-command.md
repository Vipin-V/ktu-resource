# clear command

Type `clear` to clear all the previous commands that were run in the current terminal.

The screen will clear and you will just see the prompt at the top:

> Note: this command has a handy shortcut: `ctrl-L`

Once you do that, you will lose access to scrolling to see the output of the previous commands entered.

So you might want to use `clear -x` instead, which still clears the screen, but lets you go back to see the previous work by scrolling up.
