# touch command

### The Linux `touch` command <a href="#the-linux-touch-command" id="the-linux-touch-command"></a>

You can create an empty file using the `touch` command:

```bash
touch apple
```

If the file already exists, it opens the file in write mode, and the timestamp of the file is updated.
