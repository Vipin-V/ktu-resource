# open command

### The Linux `open` command <a href="#the-linux-open-command" id="the-linux-open-command"></a>

The `open` command lets you open a file using this syntax:

```bash
open <filename>
```

You can also open a directory, which on macOS opens the Finder app with the current directory open:

```bash
open <directory name>
```

I use it all the time to open the current directory:

```bash
open .
```

> The special `.` symbol points to the current directory, as `..` points to the parent directory

The same command can also be be used to run an application:

```bash
open <application name>
```
