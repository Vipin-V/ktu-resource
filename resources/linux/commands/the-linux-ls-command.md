# The Linux ls command

Inside a folder you can list all the files that the folder contains using the `ls` command:

```bash
ls
```

If you add a folder name or path, it will print that folder's contents:

```bash
ls /bin
```

`ls` accepts a lot of options. One of my favorite combinations is `-al`. Try it:

```bash
ls -al /bin
```

Compared to the plain `ls` command, this returns much more information.

You have, from left to right:

* the file permissions (and if your system supports ACLs, you get an ACL flag as well)
* the number of links to that file
* the owner of the file
* the group of the file
* the file size in bytes
* the file's last modified datetime
* the file name

This set of data is generated by the `l` option. The `a` option instead also shows the hidden files.

Hidden files are files that start with a dot (`.`).
