# The Linux man command

The first command I'll introduce will help you understand all the other commands.

Every time I don't know how to use a command, I type `man <command>` to get the manual:

This is a man (from _\_manual\__) page. Man pages are an essential tool to learn as a developer. They contain so much information that sometimes it's almost too much.\
The above screenshot is just 1 of 14 screens of explanation for the `ls` command.

Most of the time when I need to learn a command quickly I use this site called **tldr pages**: [https://tldr.sh](https://tldr.sh/). It's a command you can install, which you then run like this: `tldr <command>`. It gives you a very quick overview of a command, with some handy examples of common usage scenarios:

This is not a substitute for `man`, but a handy tool to avoid losing yourself in the huge amount of information present in a `man` page. Then you can use the `man` page to explore all the different options and parameters you can use on a command.
